## Dataset

We have released the data on [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/datasets/ssssemma/AIS).


## Benchmark

We use several amodal segmentation methods to build the benchmark for the dataset. The codes are from their original repository:

> **SAM**: https://github.com/facebookresearch/segment-anything
> 
> **AISFormer**: https://github.com/UARK-AICV/AISFormer
> 
> **C2F-Seg**: https://github.com/JianxGao/C2F-Seg
